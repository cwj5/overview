A modern, cross-platform application for visualizing CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) grid and solution data in PLOT3D format.

## Features

- **PLOT3D File Support**: Read and parse PLOT3D binary grid files
- **3D Visualization**: Interactive 3D rendering using Three.js
- **Wireframe & Shaded Modes**: Toggle between wireframe and flat-shaded rendering
- **Multi-Grid Support**: Handle multiple computational grids
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Linux, Windows, and macOS

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Three.js
- **Backend**: Rust (via Tauri)
- **3D Rendering**: React Three Fiber + Drei
- **Desktop Framework**: Tauri 2.0

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or later)
- Rust (latest stable)
- npm

### System Requirements for Pre-built Binaries

**macOS**: 
- macOS 11.0 or later
- Intel (x86_64) or Apple Silicon (aarch64)

**Linux**:
- glibc 2.35 or later (Ubuntu 22.04+, Fedora 36+, Debian 12+, Rocky Linux 9+)
- AppImage format (no installation required, just make executable and run)

**Windows**:
- Windows 10 or later
- MSI installer

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm run tauri dev

# Build for production
npm run tauri build
```

## Testing

This project maintains high code quality with comprehensive automated tests:

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all TypeScript tests
npm test

# Run TypeScript tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Watch mode for TypeScript tests
npm run test:watch

# Run Rust library tests
cd src-tauri && cargo test --lib

# Generate Rust coverage report
cd src-tauri && cargo tarpaulin --lib --timeout 300
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Tests are automatically run before each commit to ensure code quality:

```bash
# The hooks are configured during development setup
# To bypass hooks (not recommended): git commit --no-verify
```

### Coverage Status

- **TypeScript**: 97.62% coverage (100 tests)
- **Rust**: 45.28% coverage (86 tests)
- **Total**: 186 tests across full stack

Coverage reports are generated automatically in GitHub Actions on all pull requests.

## Architecture

**Frontend (React + Three.js)**:
- Handles UI and 3D visualization
- Lightweight, focuses on rendering only
- Uses React Three Fiber for declarative 3D scenes

**Backend (Rust)**:
- Parses PLOT3D binary files efficiently
- Manages large mesh data (million+ points)
- Provides Tauri commands for file operations

## Building for Distribution

Automated builds are handled via GitHub Actions. Binaries are built for:
- **macOS**: Both Intel and Apple Silicon architectures in one .app bundle
- **Linux**: AppImage (no installation needed, portable executable)
- **Windows**: MSI installer

Builds run automatically on push to `main` branch and tagged releases. Artifacts are available in the GitHub Actions tab.

PLOT3D is a NASA-developed format for storing CFD grid and solution data. For more information, see the [PLOT3D manual](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19900013774/downloads/19900013774.pdf).
