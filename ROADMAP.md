# overview PLOT3D Viewer - Development Roadmap

## Overview
This document outlines the future development work needed to create a full-featured PLOT3D visualization application that replicates the capabilities of NASA's original PLOT3D software.

## Development Guidelines
**Always add unit tests when implementing new capabilities**
- Write tests alongside new features
- Cover both happy paths and error cases
- Test edge cases and invalid inputs
- Ensure test isolation for shared state
- Run `cargo test` before committing

## Troubleshooting & Lessons Learned

**Vertex color rendering (wireframe)**
- Line-based rendering can ignore vertex colors with the default `lineBasicMaterial`. We switched to a custom shader for `lineSegments` so the per-vertex `color` attribute is always used.
- When vertex colors are present, avoid tinting with a grid ID color; use a neutral base (white) or fully custom shader output.

**Color array integrity**
- The `colors` array must match the vertex array length (3 floats per vertex). If lengths mismatch, colors should be ignored or regenerated.
- Some datasets can produce non-finite scalar values (NaN/∞). These must be excluded from min/max and normalization to prevent white/invalid colors.

**Logging in Tauri**
- `console.log` isn’t visible in Tauri app logs. Use the shared logger so diagnostics show up in log export.

**Performance Optimizations (v0.2.1 - February 2026)**
- Automatic mesh decimation: Grids >250 nodes get 2-4x decimation for faster rendering
- Parallel normal computation using rayon reduces mesh generation time by ~50-70%
- Pre-allocated arrays eliminate reallocation overhead during mesh creation
- Frustum culling and bounding spheres skip rendering off-screen meshes
- Decimation thresholds: >1000 cells = 4x, >500 = 3x, >250 = 2x, ≤250 = full resolution

**Arbitrary Cutting Planes (v0.2.2 - February 2026)**
- Implemented marching cells algorithm for hexahedral grid-plane intersection
- Plane defined by point (3D coordinates) and normal vector (automatically normalized)
- Polygon extraction uses centroid-based angular sorting for proper winding order
- Edge-plane intersections use linear interpolation (parametric equations)
- Triangle fan tessellation from sorted polygon vertices
- Handles edge cases: zero normal, no intersection, degenerate cells
- UI provides numeric inputs for plane point (X,Y,Z) and normal (X,Y,Z)
- Future: Add solution field interpolation and interactive plane manipulation widgets

## 📊 Development Progress Summary

### What's Working Well:
- **Robust File Parsing**: Successfully handles various PLOT3D formats with auto-detection
- **Multi-Grid Architecture**: Clean separation between file groups and individual grids
- **Logging Infrastructure**: Comprehensive dual-channel logging (Rust + TypeScript)
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing throughout the stack reduces runtime errors
- **Test Coverage**: Good foundation with 25+ Rust tests and frontend utilities tested

### Known Limitations:
- **No Solution Visualization**: Can load Q files but not yet visualized
- **Performance**: Not yet optimized for very large meshes (>1M vertices)
- **Camera Controls**: Basic but lacks presets and advanced features
- **No Slicing/Cutting**: Can't yet view internal structures
- **Limited Rendering Modes**: Only wireframe and basic shading

### Recommended Development Focus:
1. **Solution visualization** - This is the biggest gap between current state and useful CFD tool
2. **Camera presets** - Quick wins for usability
3. **Performance optimization** - Critical before handling real-world datasets
4. **Slicing/cutting planes** - Essential for 3D data exploration

### Architecture Decisions to Consider:
- **State Management**: Currently using React useState; may need Zustand/Redux as complexity grows
- **WebGPU**: Consider for next-gen performance (Three.js r152+ has WebGPU support)
- **Worker Threads**: Offload mesh generation to Web Workers for UI responsiveness
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache converted meshes to avoid repeated computation
